# Predicting Traffic Accident Severity

## Description
This repository contains the datasets, Jupyter notebooks, and reports for a project aimed at predicting the severity of traffic accidents. Using machine learning models, the project seeks to identify patterns and factors that contribute significantly to accident severity to aid in preventive measures and improve road safety.

## Repository Structure
- `Business Problem and Data explained.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook explaining the business problem and data exploration process.
- `Predicting Traffic Accident Severity.ipynb`: Main notebook with the model development and evaluation.
- `Predicting Traffic Accident Severity.pdf`: Presentation summarizing the findings and methodology.
- `Predicting Traffic Accident Severity-convert...`: Detailed report of the project.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib


## Usage
To view and run the notebooks, start Jupyter Notebook in your environment:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Navigate to the notebook file you want to view and run it.
